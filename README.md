# Movie Genre Classification 

![Movie Genre Classification](movie_genre_classification.png)

## Overview

This CodeSoft project implements a movie genre classification system, leveraging natural language processing and machine learning techniques to predict the genre of a movie based on its plot summary and other relevant features. The system analyzes textual data and classifies movies into genres such as Action, Comedy, Drama, Sci-Fi, and more, providing valuable insights for content recommendation systems and movie enthusiasts.

## Key Features

- **Data Collection:** Curated a diverse dataset of movie plots and genres for training and testing the classification model.
- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):** Utilized NLP techniques to preprocess and analyze text data, extracting meaningful features for genre classification.
- **Machine Learning Model:** Implemented a machine learning model, such as a neural network or decision tree, to predict movie genres based on extracted features.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Used metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to evaluate the model's performance and ensure accurate genre predictions.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/KiranGangoor0301/movieGenre.git
